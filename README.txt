 !! Hybrid MPI with OpenMP version !! The implimentation of the parallel version Nelder-Mead algorithm in global optimization.

Fortran files:

	(1) main.f90 focuses on the implementation of the Nelder-Mead simplex method on 10 dimensional parameter space. (MPI)
	(2) equilibrium.f90 solves for the steady state of the economy.
	(3) model.f90 solves the Bellman equations for saving and consumption decisions across generations. (OpenMP)
	(4) variable.f90 initializes most variables to be used in the program.
	(5) toolbox.f90 contains all the subroutines that executes evoked numerical methods.
	
Input files:
	
	(1) _survival_probability.txt
	(2) _efficiency_units.txt
	(3) _1parameter.txt
	(4) _ShortListStartPoint.csv: generated by "sorting_on_funcval.py" serving as the short list of starting points of the Nelder-Mead algorithm. "sorting_on_funcval.py" merges and sorts the outcome obtained in the MPI_Exercise_Mode==1 case.
	
Supplemental files:

	(1) zv1.pbs: the PBS script with the specification of HPC resources to be submitted to MSI's work queue.
	(2) makefile: the script with the commands for compiling the Fortran files
